## Tech Stack
- React (with Vite)
- React Router DOM (routing)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- TMDb API (movie & TV data)
- Netlify (deployment)

## Challenges I Faced
- I had to read a lot of documentation to understand React concepts, React Router, and API integration.  
- Learning how to implement lazy loading and optimize images for faster loading took extra effort.  
- Understanding how to manage state and props between components was a challenge at first.  
- Styling with TailwindCSS required practice before I became comfortable.  
- Deploying to Netlify was new to me, so I had to experiment before getting it right.
